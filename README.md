# Introduction

The Path is a lightweight modlist with the absolute minimum fixes, gameplay balance changes and new content that can be customized to your liking. It's intended to have decent longevity and not require many updates, especially those that could cause you to need to start over.

## List Contents

You can browse the full list contents [here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/the-path) if you want to know exactly what you're getting.

## Minimum Specs
Users have reported running the list fine with as low as a Ryzen 1300x and a GTX960. You may need to adjust settings with systems this low but it should run fine and still look great!

## Community

Support is offered in [The Lost Outpost](https://discord.gg/WF66mMu) server and in the [Issues](https://github.com/Lost-Outpost/thepath/issues) section of the The Path GitHub. If you have any questions following the add-on's instructions or if you find a typo or any other mistake in the documentation, feel free to report in The Lost Outpost Discord server's support channel.

# Installation

Installation is handled through [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) with a one-click install of the modlist. There are some pre-installation steps which must be followed for first time users so please pay attention to those.

## Pre-Install

These steps are only needed if you install the Modlist for the first time.

### Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

I doubt you need to do this since you likely already have this installed. This package is required for MO2 and you can download it from [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads). Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". [Direct link](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) if you can't find it.

### Clean Enderal

I highly recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder, and reinstalling it. You should also clean up the `Enderal Special Edition` folder in `Documents/My Games/` by deleting the contents in it.

[THIS](https://imgur.com/a/1dySo8q) is approximately what a clean Enderal install should look like after shredding or cleaning it manually.

### Start Enderal
Start the game and exit once you're in the main menu. This will ensure any settings files needed by Wabbajack are created in the Enderal directory.

## Using Wabbajack

### Preparations

Download the release to a _working folder_. This folder **must not** be in a _common folder_ like your Desktop, Downloads or Program Files folder. It's best to create a Wabbajack folder near the root level of your drive like `C:/Wabbajack`.

Grab the latest release of Wabbajack from [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place the `Wabbajack.exe` file in the _working folder_.

### Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a little while (an hour or more) depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD.

1. Create a folder for the List at the root of your drive (like the Wabbajack folder) called "The Path"
2. Go back to your drive, and create a new folder, called "Wabbajack Downloads Folder". This specific folder can be on a different drive if you wish
3. Download the latest release of `The Path` from the Wabbajack Browse Modlists page
4. Select the created folder in step 1 as your installation folder
5. Select the created folder in step 2 as your downloads folder
6. Click the Go/Begin button and wait for Wabbajack to finish

### Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you lose no progress. Seriously, simply retrying the Wabbajack download fixes most problems. If you still cannot figure out the issue, please check in our support forum or the official Wabbajack discord.

# Updating

If this Modlist receives an update, please check the [changelog](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125198) before doing anything. Always backup your saves or start a new game after updating.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

This means that any additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your saves will be kept, but please check each update changelog to see if the update is save compatible. Your downloads folder will not be touched!

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.

# Startup

Open the installation folder and double click on the program called `ModOrganizer.exe`.

Make sure the dropdown box on the right is set to `The Path` and press the Run button.

# Issues

For issues, you can provide details in the [The Path Github](https://github.com/Lost-Outpost/thepath/issues). Please provide as much info as you can (screenshots are great).

Finally, free feel to hop on the The Path Discord support channel to have discussions with our knowledgeable community members. Support is offered in [The Lost Outpost](https://discord.gg/WF66mMu).
